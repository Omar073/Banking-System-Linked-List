# Banking System using Linked List (C++)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Banking System project implemented in C++ with linked list data structure. This program serves as a basic banking system, where each node in the linked list represents a user with a bank account. The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

## Features

1. **Check Balance:** Users can inquire about their account balance.

2. **Deposit:** Users can add funds to their bank accounts.

3. **Withdraw:** Users can withdraw funds from their bank accounts.

4. **Transfer Funds:** Users can transfer funds between accounts.

5. **Change Passwords:** Users can update their account passwords for added security.

6. **Check Account Details:** Users can view detailed information about their bank accounts.

## Project Structure

The project is implemented in C++ using linked list data structures and includes a GUI for an intuitive user interface.

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic and user interaction.
- `LinkedList.cpp` and `LinkedList.h`: Implement the linked list data structure to manage user accounts.
- `User.cpp` and `User.h`: Define the user class, representing individual bank accounts.
- `GUI.cpp` and `GUI.h`: Implement the graphical user interface for easy user interaction.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
